These images are tested/validated against the fleet and are known to work with our metal. For most operating systems we publish fresh images on monthly basis, this guarantees a smooth user experience and reduces install times. Images are kept as close to upstream releases as possible. Changelog The changelog aims to show what packages have changed since the last published image, what kernel and what deviations from upstream (if any) per new published image. If there is any information that would be helpful but is missing from the changelog, please raise an issue and we will do our best to add it going forward.

What's in this directory is just the upstream examples / references with some minor tweaks for color scheme and some basic modifications for for things like the \"home\" page.

It's 1-2 line delta and something based on research shouldn't require much maintenance. The only \"custom\" part of the assets is our logo and some minor css additions for table formatting, otherwise it's completely stock Pymdown extensions + material.","title":"Delivery-docs Theme"},{"location":"theme/assets/images/","text":"Favicon and Brand Images Equinix Visual Brand Guide Metal Logos Github Metal Logos Wiki Metal Brand Experience","title":"Favicon and Brand Images"}]}
